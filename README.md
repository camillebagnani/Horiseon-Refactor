# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This refactor was completed to make the Horiseon website accessible to those using a screen reader. It was accomplished using semantic HTML and adding comments to the CSS. During the project, I learned the importance of semantic HTML, the meaning of the semantic tags, how to write alt text for each image, how to consolidate CSS files and more.

## Installation

To deploy the refactor, visit the project repository > Settings > Pages > Source > Branch (main) > Save. From here you can view the finished project on GitHub Pages.

## Usage

Although no changes were made to the design and content of Horiseon's webpage, its usage has increased through semantic HTML becuase it is now accessible to those using a screen reader.
